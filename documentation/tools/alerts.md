# Alerts
{: .important-title .no_toc}

On this page, there are four different rules that have been set up. If one of these rules is met, then the user will be alerted and an event will be added underneath the corresponding rule. If an event is categorized as either high or critical severity, it will automatically alert the user. In addition, if a medium severity alert occurs 3 times in 1 minute, an alert will also go off. 

Clicking on any of the Alerts/Rule Names will expand the table. In the newly revealed table, there is a plethora of additional information that the user can use to investigate the event. There is also a ribbon containing each event that has triggered the alert.
