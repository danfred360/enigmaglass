# Using the Discover Tool
{: .important-title .no_toc}

Each of the widgets are laid out in a similar way in order to ensure ease of use for the user. Each widget will have a corresponding graph or visual tool at the top of the page. Underneath that, they share 4 tiles that include "Number of Total Hits", "Total hits on...", "Daily Percent Change", and "Weekly Percent Change".

The "Total hits on..." tile allows for customization by the user. The user can sort through information using one of eleven different filters, such as data, event type, hostname, etc. So, if the user were to select external IP, the next dropdown would include all available IP addresses to choose from. Then it will calculate the number of hits from that IP address. 

The next two tiles both deal with calculating both the daily and weekly percentage change for the total number of hits.

At the bottom of the page, the user will find the actual discover panel. Here it shows in-depth information about each security event that has occurred. You can either page through this data with the arrows at the bottom or change the total number of items per page, next to the arrows.

The user can do a quick search from the search bar in the top right. This is just a simple search field that allows users to quickly find something specific they are looking for. For example, if a user is looking for an IP that contains 237, they can type that into the search bar and filter through.

There is, however, an advanced search option as well. The main benefit of this option is that you can search multiple strings at once. For example, if you are looking for a specific IP address that has high severity, you can type both of those in and they will search as different strings.

Enigma Glass also gives you the option to select which columns to view at once, through a dropdown with checkboxes. It also allows you to export data to 5 different data types including CSV, JSON, and XLS.
