# Network Activity Tool
{: .important-title .no_toc}

The network activity tab is a visualization tool present within Enigma Glass. Multicolored lines will appear on the world map indicating where an attack originated and the target of the attack.

Highlighting one of these lines will pull up an informational box. This box includes information such as the country of origin, the target country, the type of attack, the port attacked, and the time of the attack.

In the top left, there are map controls such as fullscreen and zooming in and out. The user can also zoom in and out via the scroll wheel and pan around the map by holding down the left mouse button.

This tool is also known as "Logon Activity."
