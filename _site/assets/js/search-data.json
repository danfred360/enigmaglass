    "content": "An insider threat is the potential for an inside person to use their authorized access or understanding of an organization to harm that organization. This can include malicious acts that negatively affect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the organization, its data, personnel, or facilities. The following are behaviors/actions typical of insider threats: - Espionage - Terrorism - Unauthorized disclosure of information - Corruption, including participation in transnational organized crime - Sabotage - Workplace violence - Intentional or unintentional loss or degradation of departmental resources or capabilities . Types of Insider Threats . - Unintentional Threats . | An insider who either acts with negligence or carelessness often fall under this category. These individuals do not attempt to create a risk on purpose or maliciously. But instead create an unintended risk by mistake. These mistakes are not always preventable as sometimes mistakes like misclicks can occur. - Intentional Threats | An insider who creates risk intentionally would fall under this category as the individual in this case is acting with malicious intent. The motivation is is usually specific to the individual but company sabotage is usually the end goal. For example, many insiders are motivated to “get even” due to unmet expectations related to a lack of recognition (e.g., promotion, bonuses, desirable travel) or even termination. Their actions include leaking sensitive information, harassing associates, sabotaging equipment, or perpetrating violence. Others have stolen proprietary data or intellectual property in the false hope of advancing their careers. - Other Threats | Insider threats can come in many forms, so it’s hard to create an exhaustive list. However, some other threats to be aware of include collusive threats and third-party threats. | Collusive Threats is when more than one insider are working together with a similar goal of hurting the organization. | Third Party Threats are threats who are from outside the company, with temporary access to the inside of the organization. | . | . Mitigating Insider Threats . | Define - Determine what an insider is as well as the many forms it can take on | Detect &amp; Identify - Using both human and technological elements, monitor and identify potential threats | Assess - Using all known information, follow the response plan that aligns with the scenario | Manage - Continue to be proactive and manage an threat or potential threat | .

    "title": "Components of SIEM platform",
    "content": "A SIEM solution may cover all or only some of these components. Security concerns vary greatly from company to company, and some features are only used by government systems or where they are required by law. 1. Data Aggregation . This component of SIEM is responsible for gathering logs that are generated by devices within the corporate network, like application servers, network devices, and employee workstations. There are three major log collection methods: . | Agent-based log collection | Agentless log collection | API-based log collection | . In agent-based log collection, an agent is installed to ingest logs from a file. This doesn’t require whatever is generating the logs to support logging directly to you database; instead a seperate process watches for changes to the file and sends the data to your database in a secure manner. Agentless log collection is possible where the application that is producing the logs supports integrating with your SIEM platform directly. Basically, the agents job is wrapped up into the existing application. In API-based log collection, logs can be collected from network devices using an application programming interface (API) to collect the logs from the server using a process running on an entirely seperate server. This seperate server can then process the data it recieves through the API and send it through to your database. 2. Security Data Analytics . SIEM platforms make security data analytics possible with reports and dashboards. Security Engineers can monitor these dashboards of realtime security data to get an idea of the state of their network, and to identify potential problems as they occur. Many SIEM solutions also generate predefined reports, which assist the company in detecting threats and preparing for security audits. 3. Correlation and Security Event Monitoring . This component is on of the most powerful parts of SIEM. Predefined correlation rules allow companies to analyze log data for an relationship that exists between different network activity logs or common attributes. A simple example of a correlation rule is “If a user fails to login many times in a short persioud of time but is then able to log in succesfully, trigger an alert.” These correlation rules can detect suspicous activity, a potential breach in the network, and system compromise. Maintaining these rules is a neverending task as new vulnerabilites and attack vectors surface daily, so this is one of the beneifts of paying for a managed SIEM solution as opposed to developing one from scratch. 4. Forensic Analysis . Root cause analysis and incident reports are foundational job duties for Security Engineers. SIEM platforms make that mych easier buy allowing the user to “drill down” through logs of a breach or attack after the fact to determine exactly how the bad actor was able to gain access to the system. This component of SIEM is often legally mandated. 5. Incident Detection and Response . A security incident is an attempted or successful data breach in the corporate network by an bad actor. SIEM platforms detect security incidents as they happen using event correlation, user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA), and threat intelligence. Once the incident has been identified, many SIEM platforms support not only triggering alerts but automated actions to neutralize the threat using predefined workflows. This component of SIEM allows companies to lower their mean time to detect and resolve incidents. 6. Real-time Event Response or Alerting Console . SIEM platforms ingest network data in realtime and can instantly notify incident response teams when an incident is detected. 7. Threat Intelligence . There are many public and private threat intelligence feeds that can be used to obtain the contextual information that is require to identify potential security issues in the corporate system before they are exploited. SIEM platforms can aggregate these threat intelligence feeds and provide an environment where they can be compared to the current state of the network to identify potential security vulnerabilities. 8. User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) . UEBA uses machine learning techniques to train a behaviour model that represents the normal operation of the corporate network. Once this baseline is set, alerts can be triggered when the network activity deviates too far from the normal behaviour model. These anomolies can then be investigated further, or dealt with using predefined automated rules. UEBA differes from a correlation engine because it is not rule based. Instead it relies on behavioral analytics. 9. IT Compliance Management . Most companies are expected to meet certain regulations regarding data security. These regulations vary by industry and region, but normally there are fines associated with noncomplaince. Many of the components that have been covered here are required by some regulations. Companies may also need to comply with security audits by third party entities. SIEM platforms allow companies to prepare for these audits and know that they will pass ahead of time. ",

The communication between the agents and the server can be TLS encrypted, which makes it possible to securely ingest logs from edge devices on entirely different networks. Agents are highly configurable and can be customized to support any application that logs to a file. For example, a web server running apache could be configured with an agent that watched the connection log. This connection log alone is enough data to create some really interesting visualizations and see some bad actors in action.

    "content": "Apache Access Log . Below you can see the contents of the access.log file that is stored in logging directory of the Apache server. Every web request that the webserver receives is logged here as text. Each message contains a timestamp that can be used to index the log event. Logging Agent Configuration . Logstash is Elastic’s data processing pipeline. It is one of many solutions for loading data into the Elastic server. Below is the contents of /etc/logstash/conf.d/apache.conf which stores the filtering rules that inform the pipeline on how to format the data in the json it’s sending to the Elastic server, and where to look for the logs. Note that we’re mapping the clientip field to the type geoip . This tells the Elastic server to take the ip address data from the log event and populate additional geo fields to add to the event json that can give us coordinates for the ip. You can read more about GeoIP in the Elastic Stack here. Generating Logs . Now that Elastic is configured to ingest logs from our webserver we can generate a few logs by visiting the site in a browser. Here is what our simple website looks like: . As you can see, our site is very basic. Our connection to the site is not encrypted with TLS. The only security measures that’ve been taken on the webserver are the configuration of a firewall and access hardening (only accept ssh keys and only allow ssh connections from my home network’s external IP address). Apache Log Event . This is a screenshot of a single apache log event in Kibana, which is Elastic’s visualisation layer. This table lists all the fields contained in the event json, which contains fields that are either populated by data that comes directly from the log file, or by data that is the product of a defined data processing pipeline. This makes it possible add an intermediary processing step that can use data from the log event to generate more related data to attatch to the event. Events in Aggregate . Below is a screenshot of Kibana’s Discover page with the apache logstash index pattern selected. From this view the user can search through the events using Elastic’s powerful querying language, or simply by clicking through events and adding filters through the user interface. You might think that the only log events we should see here are the ones that were generated when we visited the site in the browser, but here we can see that there are already more requests from other external ip addresses. Who are these people? . Visualising Data . Data can be visualised in charts or graphs for aggregate analysis. Users can apply filters to the visualisations that change the scope of time and any other field in the event json. HTTP response status codes are returned by the webserver to the client to indicate whether the request has been completed sucessfully. The 5 major classes of status codes are: . | Status Code | Class | . | 100 - 199 | Informational responses | . | 200 - 299 | Sucessful responses | . | 300 - 399 | Redirection messages | . | 400 - 499 | Client error responses | . | 500 - 599 | Server error responses | . Here you can see a pie chart displaying the different status codes that have been received by the server in the last 7 days. The webserver has been running for ~4 days at this point. It looks like status code that is returned the most is 200, followed pretty closely by 404. Here’s what these codes mean: . | Status Code | Meaning | . | 200 | OK - The meaning of this code depends on the HTTP method, but this generally means that the request was sucessful. | . | 400 | Bad Request - The server is either incapable or unwilling to process the request due to a client error, like malformed syntax or deceptive request routing. | . | 404 | Not Found - The server cannot find the requested resource; the page does not exist | . | 408 | Request Timeout - The server would like to close an idle connection. | . 27.52% of the requests that our webserver has receive up until this point have returned “Not Found”. Whoever is making these requests seems to be trying to access a page that does not exists. Data visualizations can be a valuable tool when seeking to answer quick questions like “What are the most common HTTP methods that are used in our web requests?” . The HTTP method that is used to make the request determines the action to be preformed on the resource that is identified by the path in the request url. | HTTP Method | Meaning | . | GET | Used to retrieve data from a specified resource in the webserver. This is the request that’s used when you visit a page in your browser. | . | POST | Used to send data to the webserver to create or update a resource. | . | CONNECT | Used to establish a tunnel to the server indentified by the URL. | . | PRI | Used when the server receives a request that it is not set up to handle. | . | HEAD | Used to retrieve the metadata that is associated with a URL without the message body in the response, which would contain the page content in a GET request. | . | OPTIONS | Used to retreive the the permitted communication options for a URL or server. | . We can use a treemap visualisation to take a look at the most common resources that are requested (using the path in the URL) for each response code that is returned for all POST requests the the webserver has recieved: . This visualisation was created by selecting the response.keyword and request.keyword fields to group by and filtering the log events to be passed to the visualisation to POST requests. We can see that the most frequently requested resource to POST to on our webserver has a path of /boaform/admin/formLogin. A quick Google search of this path yields this article that suggests that what we might be seeing here is a botnet searching for vulnerable fiber optic routers. We can take a closer look at these requests in the Discover section with some filters: . Dashboards . Data visualistaions can be collected in dashboards which allow users to see visualisations that can be made up of data from a variety of sources. Below is a screenshot of an example overview dashboard that a webmaster might user to monitor the perfomance of their apache server. This dashboard contains a few interesting visualisations using geo data from the log events. Drilling Down . In this screenshot example, the user has “drilled down” on the client country visualisation by selecting the United States. This dashboard was created to display various geo data, but by drlling down through the webmaster dashboard a filter has been applied that only populates the visualisations with events from the United States. This dashboard has been created to display information regarding post requests made to the server. By selecting the part of the treemap that represents the 50% of requests that are targeting that boaform path, we can drill down into the geo data dashboard that we saw before with some filters applied to only show us log events that are associated with that path.

The widgets consist of: Quarantine Failure, Threat Quarantined, Vulnerable Application Detected, Cloud IOC, Security Events, Top Security Alerts, Top Users Triggering AV Alerts, DNS Trends (Cisco Umbrella), and Antivirus Events Over Time (Cisco AMP). The home screen offers a quick visual for administrators to monitor events quickly through the efficient use of graphs to break down specifics such as Top Security Alerts. There are currently 9 different widgets available when you open security events from the dashboard. Each one works similarly to the other; in that, you have the option to “Choose Timeframes” and “Discover.” . The choose timeframes option allows you to choose between 14 different intervals. These intervals will determine the timeframe of the data that the infographic will show. For example, if you have it set to a half-hour, the infographic will only show data that was gathered in the last half-hour. It is also worth noting that the currently selected option is highlighted in blue. The Discover option is a bit more complex. Choosing this option will take you to a new page with more information about the widget as shown below. This page will show you the corresponding infographic as well as the total number of hits for that category. In this example, there were 55 total discovered security events. Quarantine Failure . This widget is responsible for centralizing all known data related to quarantine failures occurring on workstations across the network. Quarantining is when a file that was supposed to be temporarily neutralized to protect the system. When this quarantine fails, it can potentially put the system at risk. Threat Quarantined . This section deals with files that have been successfully quarantined. This section can be used to deal with the threats within these files and potentially release them from quarantine. Vulnerable Application Detected . This section tracks applications and categorizes them if they are deemed vulnerable. Vulnerable applications are any programs that contain backdoors or other exploitable loopholes that could be used to access or disrupt the system. The Security Events . The security events tab contains a lot of important information. A security event can be described as unusual activity that could potentially cause harm or unintended access to a system. This page aggregates the data from these activities and categorizes them by how much of a threat they are (high, medium, or low). Top Security Alerts . Similar to the Security Events widget, the Top Security Alerts widget categorizes the events by severity: Low, Medium, High, and Critical. Top Users Triggering AV Alerts . This widget is used for tracking which user account or system is responsible for triggering the antivirus alerts. The information from this section can be used to decide whether or not employees need more training, or even if there is a risk of an insider threat. Antivirus Events Over Time (Cisco AMP) . This is a fairly simple section. It aggregates the information from every type of antivirus event. This includes events listed above such as a quarantine failure, threat detected, malware executed, etc. ",

The “Total hits on…” tile allows for customization by the user. The user can sort through information using one of eleven different filters, such as data, event type, hostname, etc. So, if the user were to select external IP, the next dropdown would include all available IP addresses to choose from. Then it will calculate the number of hits from that IP address. The next two tiles both deal with calculating both the daily and weekly percentage change for the total number of hits. At the bottom of the page, the user will find the actual discover panel. Here it shows in-depth information about each security event that has occurred. You can either page through this data with the arrows at the bottom or change the total number of items per page, next to the arrows. The user can do a quick search from the search bar in the top right. This is just a simple search field that allows users to quickly find something specific they are looking for. For example, if a user is looking for an IP that contains 237, they can type that into the search bar and filter through. There is, however, an advanced search option as well. The main benefit of this option is that you can search multiple strings at once. For example, if you are looking for a specific IP address that has high severity, you can type both of those in and they will search as different strings. Enigma Glass also gives you the option to select which columns to view at once, through a dropdown with checkboxes. It also allows you to export data to 5 different data types including CSV, JSON, and XLS. ",

Clicking on any of the Alerts/Rule Names will expand the table. In the newly revealed table, there is a plethora of additional information that the user can use to investigate the event. There is also a ribbon containing each event that has triggered the alert. ",
